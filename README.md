Inverted search :

An Inverted Index is a data structure used in information retrieval systems to efficiently retrieve documents or web pages containing a specific term or set of terms. In an inverted index, the index is organized by terms (words), and each term points to a list of documents or web pages that contain that term.

Inverted indexes are widely used in search engines, database systems, and other applications where efficient text search is required. They are especially useful for large collections of documents, where searching through all the documents would be prohibitively slow.

An inverted index is an index data structure storing a mapping from content, such as words or numbers, to its locations in a document or a set of documents. In simple words, it is a hashmap-like data structure that directs you from a word to a document or a web page.
